## The Game

Rage of The Elders is a Side-Scroller Beat 'em Up game developed by a group of college students during the discipline of Introduction to Game Development on Universidade de Brasília - Brazil.

The story takes place during the 90's in a nursing home, where live two elders that are unhappy about their situation. Missing the "good ol' times", when they were fulfilled with their lives, doing what they love, until a terrible accident left lifetime injuries, disabling them.

In the limit of their anger and frustration, they decide to make a escape plan, and nothing or nobody will stop 'em. These two brave old friends will use the abilities they learned and improved over the years to face malicious caregivers, sadistic nurses and ruthless security guards, committed to reach the ultimate challenge, that will lead them to the craved freedom.

## Objectives

Rage of the Elders is a fighting game, where the character progresses through the stage facing the enemies. The player must overcome several hordes of enemies, and beat the final Boss to win the game. If the character die in the process, the game must be restarted from the beginning.

## Controlls

The game is controlled by the keyboard, where:

- Movement is controlled by the Arrow Keys;
- Basic attacks are triggered by the 'A' and 'S' keys;
- A combination of basic attacks lead to a special Combo attack;
- When the points bar is filled, a Ultimate Attack can be triggered pressing 'D';

## How to Run

- *Compiler:* GCC 4.8.1 + (or anything with C++11 support);
- *Libraries:* SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer and SDL2_TTF;
